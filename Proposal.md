-As a [user] I should get an error message if the color I want to input is not a selection.
-As a [user] I should see a text of the color I inputed appear before me (maybe the background color changes for each input selection not sure on the web page because this may be to busy being =>) that when I hover over that text I see the color change.
-As a [user] I should be able to click on the text/link and go to another page where I see a body of text that explains the psychology of the color I choose.
