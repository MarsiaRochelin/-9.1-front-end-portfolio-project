        >Yellow is the color of the mind and the intellect, resonating with the
        left, logical side of the brain. It is creative, the tone of new ideas
        and new ways of doing things. Post-it notes and legal pads were invented
        in yellow for a very good reason! Being the lightest hue of the
        spectrum, yellow is uplifting and illuminating, offering hope,
        happiness, and fun. It’s a warm and happy color that creates a sense of
        cheerfulness and playfulness, brightening people’s spirits. However, too
        much yellow can cause anxiety, nervousness, apprehension, agitation, and
        confrontation particularly in people who are already stressed. It can
        also suggest impatience, criticism, and cowardice, and motivate people
        to become overly critical, judgmental, and deceitful. Avoid dressing in
        yellow when trying to influence men. They tend to see it as cheap and
        unsophisticated. However, it’s brilliant to help stand out from the
        crowd and can easily be paired with a moderating shade to add more
        authority such as mid-blue or forest green. Yellow ties have fallen from
        the power tie rack recently but can still be worn successfully in a
        yellow and blue foulard print or polka dot.
