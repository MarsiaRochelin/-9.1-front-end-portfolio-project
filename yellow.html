        >Positive Associations: Yellow is the color of the mind and the
        intellect, resonating with the left, logical side of the brain. It is
        creative, the tone of new ideas and new ways of doing things. Being the
        lightest hue of the spectrum, yellow is uplifting and illuminating,
        offering hope, happiness, and fun. It’s a warm and happy color that
        creates a sense of cheerfulness and playfulness, brightening people’s
        spirits.

      <strong>
        Negative Associations: Too much yellow can cause anxiety, nervousness,
        apprehension, agitation, and confrontation particularly in people who
        are already stressed. It can also suggest impatience, criticism, and
        cowardice, and motivate people to become overly critical, judgmental,
        and deceitful.
