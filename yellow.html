        >Positive Association: Yellow is the color of the mind and the intellect,
        resonating with the left, logical side of the brain. It is creative, the
        tone of new ideas and new ways of doing things. Post-it notes and legal
        pads were invented in yellow for a very good reason! Being the lightest
        hue of the spectrum, yellow is uplifting and illuminating, offering
        hope, happiness, and fun. It’s a warm and happy color that creates a
        sense of cheerfulness and playfulness, brightening people’s spirits.

      <strong>
        Negative Association: Too much yellow can cause anxiety, nervousness,
        apprehension, agitation, and confrontation particularly in people who
        are already stressed. It can also suggest impatience, criticism, and
        cowardice, and motivate people to become overly critical, judgmental,
        and deceitful.
