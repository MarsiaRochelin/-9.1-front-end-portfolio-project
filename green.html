      <strong>
        Green is of nature, of balance and growth. It is restful and secure,
        symbolizing harmony, healing, and stability. It also represents security
        and self-reliance. Darker greens relate to money, wealth and prestige,
        while lighter greens relate to rebirth, growth, and freshness. However,
        too much green can lead to feelings of envy, greed, jealousy, and
        selfishness. In business, green is beneficial for anything to do with
        health and healing and promoting natural, safe, organic, environmentally
        friendly products. Dark green is a good choice for money and financial
        websites. Wear it safely and to your advantage at work, in sales
        presentations, asking for funding or a loan. On the lighter side of the
        green, turquoise and aqua are two of the most popular colors, like the
        darker teal, all made from varying amounts of blue and green. They
        remind one of sunlight on a blue sea, health, peace and abundance. Use
        the colors in solids or prints as tops, blouses and shells under
        pantsuits with camel, beige, taupe as well as purple and charcoal. Men
        can wear teal ties to their advantage when they want to look
        approachable and authoritative.
