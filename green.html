        Positive Associations: Green is of nature, of balance and growth. It is
        restful and secure, symbolizing harmony, healing, and stability. It also
        represents security and self-reliance. Darker greens relate to money,
        wealth and prestige, while lighter greens relate to rebirth, growth, and
        freshness.
