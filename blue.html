      <strong>
        Positive Associations: Blue is the color of trust, serenity, and peace.
        It suggests loyalty and integrity as well as conservatism and
        predictability. It's calming, reducing tension and fear, slowing the
        pulse rate and reducing appetite. While inspiring wisdom and higher
        ideals, it is sincere, reserved, and quiet. Being cool, it creates a
        sensation of space. Blue is said to be the most universally favored
        color of all colors.
