      <strong>
        Positive Associations: Blue is the color of trust, serenity, and peace. It suggests loyalty and
        integrity as well as conservatism and predictability. This has the
        opposite effect on the brain than red. It is calming, reducing tension
        and fear, slowing the pulse rate and reducing appetite. While inspiring
        wisdom and higher ideals, it is sincere, reserved, and quiet. Being
        cool, it creates a sensation of space. Because blue is the most
        universally favored color of all, it is the safest to use in business
        and airline uniforms. It relates to trust, honesty, and
        dependability,therefore helping to build customer loyalty. Blue works
        well for the corporate world and is often used in important meetings.
        Wear it when interviewing, and meeting business professionals such as
        accountants,insurance companies, bankers and other financial companies
        where trust and reliability are important.

        Negative Associations: Navy blue can seen as mature,conservative, boring
        or denote a rigid outlook. However, there are many blues that are more
        exciting than the navy. Think of a royal or a tealblue that is credible
        yet more interesting. Royal blue ties are the politicianâ€™s uniform and
        very predictable. Great for a conservativeaudience perhaps. Vary it a
        little with a blue or navy suit and white or pale blue shirts.
