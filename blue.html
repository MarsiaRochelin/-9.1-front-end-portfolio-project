        Blue is the color of trust, serenity, and peace. It suggests loyalty and
        integrity as well as conservatism and predictability. This has the
        opposite effect on the brain than red. It is calming, reducing tension
        and fear, slowing the pulse rate and reducing appetite. While inspiring
        wisdom and higher ideals, it is sincere, reserved, and quiet. Being
        cool, it creates a sensation of space. Because blue is the most
        universally favored color of all, it is the safest to use in business
        and airline uniforms. It relates to trust, honesty, and dependability,
        therefore helping to build customer loyalty. Blue works well for the
        corporate world and is often used in important meetings. Wear it when
        interviewing, and meeting business professionals such as accountants,
        insurance companies, bankers and other financial companies where trust
        and reliability are important. The downfall of blue and especially navy
        is that it can seem mature, conservative, boring or denote a rigid
        outlook. However, there are many blues that are more exciting than the
        navy. Think of a royal or a teal blue that is credible yet more
        interesting. Royal blue ties are the politicianâ€™s uniform and very
        predictable. Great for a conservative audience perhaps. Vary it a little
        with a blue or navy suit and white or pale blue shirts. What about a tie
        in varying shades of blue with a splash of red!
