      While perceptions of color are some what subjective colors can have
      universal effects and/or meaning. Colors (red, orange, and yellow) in the
      red area of the color spectrum are known as warm colors. These warm colors
      evoke emotions ranging from feelings of warmth and comfort to feelings of
      anger and hostility. Colors (blue, purple, and green) on the blue side of
      the spectrum are known as cool colors. These colors are often described as
      calm, but can also call to mind feelings of sadness or indifference.
