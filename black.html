      <strong>
        Positive Associations: Black asserts attractiveness, elegance, and
        sophistication. It evokes strong feelings of anger, aggression, fear, and
        sadness.

      <strong>
        Negative assositaions: Black is probably most
        clearly seen in our language. Just consider these commonly used
        expressions: Black Monday. Black Plague. Black magic. Blackball.
        Blackhole. Black-hearted. Black mood. Black sheep. Blackmail. Black
        market. Blackout. The list could go on. And nothing says "bad guy" quite
        like the color black. Though black is worn (and often preferred) by
        people from all walks of society, it's often seen as the stereotypical
        color for criminals and villains. Why do you think the color of choice
        for villains (think Dracula and Darth Vader) and other shady movie and
        TV show characters is almost always black?
