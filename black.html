        Positive Associations For some, black evokes positive associations with
        this color, including attractiveness and elegance.1 ﻿ The color oozes
        sophistication. That’s why so many people choose to don black clothing
        when attending a fancy event. It’s also why high-end brands like Tiffany
        & Co. and Chanel utilize black in their logos.2﻿ When it comes to high
        society, the color black has long been associated with power. From
        priests to judges, tuxedos to credit cards. And let’s not forget about
        Steve Jobs. Negative Associations However, many use the color black to
        symbolize all things negative. Throughout history, this somber color has
        been tied to death and all things evil and bad. It evokes strong
        feelings of anger, aggression, fear, and sadness.3﻿ The connection
        between black and negativity is probably most clearly seen in our
        language. Just consider these commonly used expressions: Black Monday.
        Black Plague. Black magic. Blackball. Blackhole. Black-hearted. Black
        mood. Black sheep. Blackmail. Black market. Blackout. The list could go
        on. And nothing says "bad guy" quite like the color black. Though black
        is worn (and often preferred) by people from all walks of society,4﻿
        it's often seen as the stereotypical color for criminals and villains.5﻿
        Why do you think the color of choice for villains (think Dracula and
        Darth Vader) and other shady movie and TV show characters is almost
        always black?
